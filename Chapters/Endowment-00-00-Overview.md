## Commentary

| ﻿[Top](#overview) | [Com](#commentary) | [Motiv](#motivate) | [Name](#name) | [Estab](#establish) | [Focus](#focus) | [Apnd](#appendices) | [Rep](#reports)

The challenges of recent courtroom decisions prompted this exploration and documentation of what happens next and what may be accomplished. The "Motivate" section lists several relevant questions and proposals. 

The main proposal is to create a non-profit organization enabling individuals to pool resources and support those in need. Support may be provided in a variety of ways, as outlined in the “Focus” section.

During the middle and latter half of 2022 changes to the law of the land will take effect. These changes are instigated by several end-of-term Supreme Court decisions, handed down in June. Many dates are remembered, as beginnings and endings:

- July 4th - US Declaration of Independence
- Jan. 6th - US Capitol building is attacked
- Sept. 11th - US is hit by suicidal terrorists
- June 24th - US Supreme Court over-turns Roe

With June 24th in mind, the first focus is to add to the educational process, also outlined in the "Focus" section. 

To educate is to share information. To do so, all related documents have been published on-line using free and well established public providers (Github, Pastebin) in a non-proprietary file format, readable by any software. Each section is contained in a stand-alone shareable and updatable document. 

Eventually the documents may be made available to the public under a designated internet domain, examples of which are listed in the "Name" section. 

The intent is to be an "open-source" organization, transparent to all, allowing others to boot-strap similar efforts.

Also, these documents are intentionally terse, including this document, presented in a cookbook fashion. Ten minutes of reading should impart a comprehensive understanding of intent and goals.

- Endowment-04-00-Focus.md

The focus of the organization, its raison d'être, is listed in seven sub-sections starting with the highest priority and earliest actions. As the organization grows the range of support it offers may grow also. 

Starting small with little or no funding is baked into the plan. This documentation is an example.

- Educational
- Financial
- Medical
- Technological
- Situational
- Legal
- Logistical

The intent is to be an "open-source" organization, transparent to all, allowing others to boot-strap similar efforts.
