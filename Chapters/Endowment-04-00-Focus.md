# Focus

- Endowment-04-00-Focus.md

Information and education is a large part of the over-all focus.

The focus of the organization, its raison d'être, is listed in seven sub-sections starting with the highest priority, least costly, and earliest actions. 

Without reinventing the wheel, the organization may collaborate with well-established organizations that have overlapping interests. The organization later may provide referrals to vetted providers and may develop programs in-house. 

## Educational

The internet is a means to obtaining nearly unlimited information on any topic imaginable.

- Health care and preventive care
- Personal finance, budgeting, insurance, taxes, savings, retirement
- Employment training - skills, searches, resumes, interviews
- General Educational Development (GED) certification
- Professional development

- Leverage on-line media to reach the masses
   - Wikipedia
	 - Podcasts
	 - Blogs 
	 - Influencers
- Coalitions and collaborations to build strength

## Financial

- Endowment-04-02-Financial.md

The cost of most products and services will never be reduced, at best the increases in cost may moderate or slow. 

Many individuals struggle to afford necessary products and services for their health and well-being. Federal and State governments have traditionally subsidized some costs. Charitable organizations also subsidize some costs. 

Additional subsidies provided to individuals will never be unwelcome. The organization may work with established organizations and programs to supplement targeted subsidies. The organization may also collect, edit, and publish information pertaining to available subsidies and related resources.

- Individual and family subsidies
- Organizational contributions
- Emergency support
- Crowd funding

## Medical

- Endowment-04-03-Medical.md

Given recent courtroom decisions and an evolving legal environment there is a growing need for medical support and information. 

Collecting, editing, and publishing this information for the organization's targeted audience is a first step in providing some level of support. As collaborative efforts mature and related information is collected the organization may make referrals, and coordinate services such as transportation or tele-medicine. 

As the organization grows and enjoys more stable funding, additional capital-intensive support programs may be developed. 

- Tele-medicine 
- Transportation 
- Referrals

## Technological

- Endowment-04-04-Technological.md

Day-to-day use of modern interconnected devices reveals more about an individual than may be understood. 

On-line service providers are lightly regulated with respect to data privacy. 

Minimizing information sharing is a good defensive and a preventative strategy that any individual may employ at no financial cost.

All of the topics listed have been covered a dozen times over in dozen of on-line locations. More than one individual or organization has collected related information into a single repository. 

However, challenges in finding the information and the manner of presentation prevent the average technology user from gaining practical knowledge. Collecting, editing, and publishing this information to targeted clients and colleagues provides a first step in minimizing their unintentional information sharing.

## Situational

With recent courtroom decisions and less than favorable economic conditions there may arise emergencies

- Medical support
- Financial support
- Legal support
- Technological support
- Legislative Action
- Referrals

## Legal

- Endowment-04-06-Legal.md

There are many individuals and organizations providing legal support. 

With recent courtroom decisions these resources have become more valuable. Collaborating with like-minded individuals and organizations and publishing contact information will benefit many. Minimally publishing  list-of-lists will be beneficial. 

The organization may help finding the door, opening the door, and taking the first step in. 

- Preferred vendors list, vetted public defenders, and law firms
- Coordinate with established legal and civic organizations
- Preventive and common legal forms - leases, licenses
- Referrals
