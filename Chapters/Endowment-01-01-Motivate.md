The challenges of recent courtroom decisions prompted some exploration and documentation. 

These four sub-sections provide some history, a few ideas, and a few proposals.

## What's next... 
>+49 years

- National activism
   - on-going
- State activism
   - on-going
- Community activism
   - on-going
- Coalition building
   - on-going
- Owning the cons 
   - on-going
   - they often undo themselves
   - keep them talking
- Underwriting needs
   - on-going
   - an important focus

While owning the cons is fun, politicking does some good, and coalition building adds strength - the focus here is "Underwriting needs". 

## Current context

- Politics and the courts are not consistently  providing support
- Individuals and organizations remain free to provide support
- Organizations remain free to raise money and coordinate resources
- Individuals and organizations remain free to publish information
- Organizations remain free to employ individuals to further their goals

There is some concern that freedom of speach will be curtailed in certain states, regarding differing laws between states. 

Interstate commerce with respect to differing state laws may also be of concern. 

Though the context is unsettled the old adage "It's better to ask forgiveness than permission" applies now more than ever.

## Current stance

- Intentionally establish a lightning-rod organization
- Take some heat off of certain politicians, corporations, and citizens
- Provide targeted organizations with strong and reasonable responses to criticism and backlash
- Lead the game of whack-a-mole on issues, requiring critics to play catch-up

Some people have shown "it is better to act than it is to react", though the particular act may be honorable or dishonorable. 

Acting honorably and consistently establishes a stronger position, easier to maintain and defend. 

Honorable collaboritive action is stronger still.
