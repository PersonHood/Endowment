##Commentary

The challenges of recent courtroom decisions prompted this exploration and documentation of what happens next and what may be accomplished. The "Motivate" section lists several relevant questions and proposals. 

The main proposal is to create a non-profit organization enabling individuals to pool resources and support those in need. Support may be provided in a variety of ways, as outlined in the “Focus” section

Many dates are remembered, as beginnings and endings:

- July 4th - the US Declaration of Independence was ratified
- January 6th - the US Capitol building is attacked by a mob of Trump supporters
- September 11th - the US is hit by coordinated suicide terrorist attacks
- June 24th - the US Supreme Court over-turned Roe v Wade

With June 24th in mind, the first focus is to educate, also outlined in the "Focus" section. 

To educate is to share information. To do so all related documents have been published on-line using free and public providers (Github, Pastebin). Eventually the documents may be made available to the public under a designated internet domain, examples of which are listed in the "Name" section. 

The intent is to be an "open-source" organization, transparent to all, allowing others to boot-strap similar efforts.

These documents are intentionally terse, including this document, presented in a cookbook fashion. 

Ten minutes of reading should impart a comprehensive understanding of the intent and goals. Each section is contained in a stand-alone shareable document, that may be updated as needed.

These may also include the stories experienced by those within and served by the organization.

- Meetings
- Finances
- Journals
