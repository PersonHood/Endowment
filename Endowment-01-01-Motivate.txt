The challenges of recent courtroom decisions prompted some exploration and documentation. These four sub-sections provide some history, some ideas, and some proposals.

##What's happened... (-49 years)

- Is politics alone effective? No.
- Is the court of law alone effective? No.
- Is support and a person's stories enough? No.
- Is the nation and are the states settled? No.
- Is banging your head against a wall effective? No.
- Is only doing the same thing over again sane? No.

##What's next... (+49 years)

- National activism - on-going
- State activism - on-going
- Community activism - on-going
- Coalition building - on-going
- Owning the cons - on-going + they often undermine themselves, keep them talking
- Underwriting needs - on-going + an increasing focus

While owning the cons is fun, politicing does some good, and coalition building adds strength - this plan is about "Underwriting needs". 

##Current context

- Politics and the courts are not consistently  providing support
- Individuals and organizations remain free to provide support
- Organizations remain free to raise money and coordinate resources
- Individuals and organizations remain free to publish information
- Organizations remain free to employ individuals to further their goals

##Current stance

- Intentionally establish a lightning-rod organization
- Take some heat off of politicians, corporations, and citizens
- Provide targeted organizations with strong and reasonable responses to criticisms
- Lead the game of whack-a-mole on issues requiring critics to play catch-up
